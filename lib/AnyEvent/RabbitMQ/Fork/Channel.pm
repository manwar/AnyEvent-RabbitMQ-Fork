AnyEvent::RabbitMQ::Fork::Channel - Facade over L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ::Channel>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ch = $rf->open_channel;
    $ch->declare_exchange(exchange => 'test_exchange');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an API to L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ::Channel> that is running in
a fork maintained by L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ::Fork>. Note that this is a facade
and not a subclass. It does however attempt to honor the public interface of
the real thing.

There are some undocumented features of the real module that are not implemented
here. I leave that as an excercise for the reader to discover. At such a time as
those features appear to become formalized, I will expose them here.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item B<id> Numerical ID assigned by the connection object and used in
coordination with the server.

=item B<is_open> Indicator if this channel is open for use.

=item B<is_active> Indicator if the server has sent a C<Channel.Flow> frame as
a form of throttle control. Will be true if that is the case.

=item B<is_confirm> Indicator if the channel is in confirm mode, meaning the
server will Ack/Nack/Return every message published.
